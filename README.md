# TourismWeb
This HTML code creates a tourism website with sections for various destinations. It utilizes Bootstrap for styling buttons and carousels. JavaScript toggles section visibility. Each section features a brief description and images of the destination.

This HTML code is for a simple tourism website with multiple sections. Here's a brief description:

1. Structure: The HTML structure is divided into different sections (section-1, section-2, etc.) using <div> tags with unique IDs for each section.
2. Content: Each section contains information about different tourist destinations.
3. Styling: The styling is done using CSS to define the layout, colors, fonts, and background images for various elements.
4. Bootstrap: Bootstrap classes are used for styling buttons (btn and btn-primary classes) and for creating a carousel (carousel class). Bootstrap's grid system isn't extensively used here, but some 
   grid-like layout is achieved using flexbox.
5. JavaScript: JavaScript functions are used to toggle the visibility of sections onclick of buttons (display() function).
6. Images: Images are included within <img> tags with URLs pointing to external sources.
7. Carousel: Carousel components are included for displaying multiple images of each tourist destination.
   Overall, it's a visually appealing website template that provides information about tourist destinations and allows users to navigate between different sections seamlessly.
